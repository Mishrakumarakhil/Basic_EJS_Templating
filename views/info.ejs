<strong>EJS:</strong> EJS or Embedded Javascript Templating is a templating engine used by Node.js. Template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into HTML template at the client side and produce the final HTML. EJS is a simple templating language which is used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It also helps to embed JavaScript to HTML pages. To begin with, using EJS as templating engine we need to install EJS using given command:
  <br>
<h1>npm install ejs --save</h1><br>

<strong>Note:</strong>npm in the above commands stands for the node package manager, a place where install all the dependencies. â€“save flag is no longer needed after Node 5.0.0 version, as all the modules that we now install will be added to dependencies.
Now, the first thing we need to do is to set EJS as our templating engine with Express which is a Node.js web application server framework, which is specifically designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. It has become the standard server framework for node.js.
